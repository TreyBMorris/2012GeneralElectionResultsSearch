# 2012-Election-Results-Search

This project is apart of a Data Lab Project for my AP Computer Science class.
It uses the Sinbad Library which can be found here: http://cs.berry.edu/sinbad/index-java.php
Sinbad is able to use links to json,csv, or xml files to import data that can be parsed into retreivable information.
For this project, I was assigned with the task of answering a question. The question I decided to answer was "What are my counties election results from the 2012 election?" I decided on this because 2012 was the first Presidential election I can fully remember the lead up and build up to, I was in Kindergarten in 2008 and 4th grade in 2012. With this program you are able to enter the name of a county and it will return every county name within the United States and give the vote count of each candidate and the party they represent for the county. For example, you could search up, "Gwinnett" for Gwinnett county Georiga and it will return any county name within the United States with the name "Gwinnett", fortunatly there is only one Gwinnett county in the United States.
